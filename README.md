# 2024-Billionaires-Data-analysis
This project analyzes the 2024 Billionaire Data, providing insights into global wealth distribution, industry trends, and billionaire demographics. Using an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, the data is cleaned, transformed, and visualized to uncover meaningful patterns in billionaire wealth across industries and countries.
Data Analytics Workflow:
ETL Process: Extracting raw data, transforming it through cleaning and structuring, and loading it for analysis.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, converting financial data into numerical formats, and standardizing categorical variables.
Data Manipulation: Utilizing Pandas & NumPy to filter, aggregate, and structure the dataset for deeper analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying key trends in net worth, industry dominance, country-wise wealth concentration, and gender representation.
Data Visualization: Leveraging Matplotlib & Seaborn to create bar charts, scatter plots, and pie charts for effective insight generation.
This project demonstrates data-driven decision-making by leveraging Python-based data analytics to help businesses, investors, and economists understand which sectors drive billionaire wealth and how global wealth trends evolve over time.
